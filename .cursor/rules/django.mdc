# Django Guidelines

- Write clear, technical responses with precise Django examples.
- Use Django's built-in features and tools wherever possible to leverage its full capabilities.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability; follow Django's coding style guide (PEP 8 compliance).
- Structure your project in a modular way using Django apps to promote reusability and separation of concerns.
- Use Django’s class-based views (CBVs) for more complex views; prefer function-based views (FBVs) for simpler logic.
- Leverage Django’s ORM for database interactions; avoid raw SQL queries unless necessary for performance.
- Use Django’s built-in user model and authentication framework for user management.
- Use middleware judiciously to handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and caching.
- Assume all migrations have been run. Never edit an existing migration file.

## Django Error Handling and Validation
- Implement error handling at the view level and use Django's built-in error handling mechanisms.
- Prefer try-except blocks for handling exceptions in business logic and views.
- Customize error pages (e.g., 404, 500) to improve user experience and provide helpful information.
- Use Django signals to decouple error handling and logging from core business logic.

## Djanog Dependencies
- Django
- Django Ninja (for API development)
- Celery (for background tasks)
- Redis (for caching and task queues)
- PostgreSQL (preferred databases for production)

## Django and Vue Specific Guidelines

- Prefer using Django Ninja based APIs for newer development.
- Prefer creating VueJS components for new components instead of using Django templates.
- Keep business logic in models and api endpoints to minimum; keep views light and focused on request handling.
- Use Django's URL dispatcher (urls.py) to define clear and RESTful URL patterns.
- Apply Django's security best practices (e.g., CSRF protection, SQL injection protection, XSS prevention).
- Always use pytest for testing.
- Use Django’s built-in tools for testing (pytest-django) to ensure code quality and reliability.
- Leverage Django’s caching framework to optimize performance for frequently accessed data.
- Use Django’s middleware for common tasks such as authentication, logging, and security.
- Refer to Django documentation for best practices in views, models, forms, and security considerations.
