# Contributing guidelines

We 💙 [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
for fixing issues or adding features. Thanks for your contribution!

Please read our [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md), which is based on
[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)

For small changes, especially documentation, you can simply use the "Edit"
button to update the Markdown file, and start the
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) process.
Use the preview tab in GitHub to make sure that it is properly formatted
before committing.
A pull request will cause integration tests to run automatically, so please
review the results of the pipeline and correct any mistakes that are reported.

If you plan to contribute often or have a larger change to make, it is best to
setup an environment for contribution, which is what the rest of these
guidelines describe.

## Development Environment Setup

### GitHub Repository Clone

To prepare your dedicated GitHub repository:

1. Fork in GitHub <https://github.com/sbomify/sbomify>
2. Clone _your forked repository_ (e.g., `git clone git@github.com:yourname/sbomify`)
3. Set your remotes as follows:

   ```sh
   cd sbomify
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:sbomify/sbomify.git
   git remote set-url upstream --push DISABLED
   ```

   Running `git remote -v` should give something similar to:

   ```text
   origin  git@github.com:yourname/sbomify.git (fetch)
   origin  git@github.com:yourname/sbomify.git (push)
   upstream        git@github.com:sbomify/sbomify.git (fetch)
   upstream        DISABLED (push)
   ```

   The use of `upstream --push DISABLED` is to prevent those
   with `write` access to the main repository from accidentally pushing changes
   directly.

### Development Process

1. Fetch latest changes from main repository:

   ```sh
   git fetch upstream
   ```

1. Reset your fork's `master` branch to exactly match upstream `master`:

   ```sh
   git checkout master
   git reset --hard upstream/master
   git push --force
   ```

   **IMPORTANT**: Do this only once, when you start working on new feature as
   the commands above will completely overwrite any local changes in `master` content.
1. Edit, edit, edit, and commit your changes to Git:

   ```sh
   # edit, edit, edit
   git add *
   git commit -m 'A useful commit message'
   git push
   ```

1. How to run tests:

   ```sh
   # explain tests here
   ```

1. Open a new Pull Request to the main repository using your `master` branch
