# ADR-002 - Languages and Frameworks

As a rule of thumb, we shall always use static typing where it is an option.

For all external libraries and dependencies, we shall always use a package manager regardless of the language. Without this, we cannot manage vulnerabilities nor generate SBOMs.

Regardless of language, linting shall be used.

## Backend

- For the backend, we shall use Python with type hints.
- For package management, we are using UV.
- As outlined in ADR-001, Django shall be used.
- For tests, we are using pytest.

## Frontend

- All JavaScript shall be written as TypeScript.
- Front-end code shall be tested using Bun's test runner.
- For the package manager, we are using Bun.
  - Avoid calling external JavaScript from the codebase; instead, use packages managed by the package manager.
- As per ADR-001, the front-end shall use Django Templates, but we will still rely on JavaScript components.
- For styling, we are migrating from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS (see ADR-005 for full architecture).
- For client-side reactivity, we use Alpine.js with HTMX for server-driven updates (see ADR-005).

## Runtime

To minimize the delta between development, staging, and production, all environments shall be running in Docker (or Podman) using the `docker compose` files.

You may choose to run things without containers when developing, but you shall always test that things work with Docker.

## Authentication

For authentication, we are using [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/). This is spun up and automatically bootstrapped if you are using the developer environment.
