    <h1>Invite your team, {{ user.first_name|default:user.username }}!</h1>
    <p>
        You've been using sbomify for a while now. Did you know you can invite your team
        to collaborate on software security?
    </p>
    <h2>Why Collaborate?</h2>
    <ul class="feature-list">
        <li>
            <strong>Shared visibility:</strong> Everyone sees the same security dashboard
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Faster response:</strong> Multiple team members can address vulnerabilities
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Role-based access:</strong> Assign admin or member roles to control permissions
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Team Roles</h2>
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>
            <strong>Owners</strong> have full control over the workspace, including billing and settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Admins</strong> can manage products, projects, components, and SBOMs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Members</strong> can view and upload SBOMs within their assigned scope.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Trust Center</h2>
    <p>
        You can also share your security posture with customers and partners through your
        <strong>Trust Center</strong> — a public or gated page that showcases your compliance status.
