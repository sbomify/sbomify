    <h1>Ready to create your first component, {{ user.first_name|default:user.username }}?</h1>
    <p>
        It's been a few days since you joined sbomify. Creating your first component is the first step
        to tracking your software's security.
    </p>
    <h2>What Is a Component?</h2>
    <p>
        A component represents a piece of software you want to track — like a library, microservice, or application.
        Each component can have SBOMs uploaded to it for vulnerability scanning.
    </p>
    <h2>Create a Component in 2 Steps</h2>
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>
            <strong>Step 1:</strong> Pick a name for your software (like "my-web-app")
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> Write a short description
        </p>
        <p>That's it! You can then upload an SBOM to start scanning for vulnerabilities.</p>
