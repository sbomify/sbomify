How sbomify Works
sbomify organizes your software in a simple way that matches how you build things:

Products → Projects → Components

Products are your main software (like "Online Store" or "Banking App")
Projects are the different parts of your product (like "Website", "Mobile App", "Payment System")
Components are the specific pieces you want to track - like code libraries or apps that make up your projects

What sbomify Can Do
- SBOM Management: Upload and check Software Bills of Materials to see what's in your software.
- Release Management: Create releases that group specific versions of your software pieces together.
- Security Scanning: Automatically find security problems in all your software.
- Workspace Collaboration: Work with your workspace members to keep all your software secure.

{% if workspace_name %}
You're currently part of the {{ workspace_name }} workspace.
{% if user_role == "owner" %}You can invite workspace members and change workspace settings from your dashboard.{% endif %}
{% endif %}

Pro Tip: Start by creating a product for one of your main software programs. Then add a project for a specific app within that product, and finally create components for the important software pieces you want to track.
