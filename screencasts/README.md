# Screencasts

Playwright-driven recordings of the app, rendered at **1920x1080** video with
**3840x2160** stills. Two kinds live here:

- **FAQ recordings** — one file per flow (`vex_upload.py`, `trust_center_setup.py`,
  …), each showing a single task. These pair with a specific FAQ entry on
  sbomify.com, which supplies the surrounding explanation.
- **The marketplace walkthrough** — `marketplace_walkthrough.py` and
  `walkthrough_chapters.py`. A narrated product tour meant to play cold next to
  a marketplace listing, with no surrounding text to lean on.

## Recording

```bash
./bin/record_screencasts.sh list                      # what's available
./bin/record_screencasts.sh marketplace_walkthrough.py
./bin/record_screencasts.sh all
```

Output lands in `screencasts/output/` (the `.webm`s and the screenshot tree are
git-ignored):

```text
output/
  marketplace_walkthrough.webm            # the ~3.5 min hero video
  walkthrough_chapters_supply_chain.webm  # the same chapters, as short clips
  walkthrough_chapters_inventory.webm
  walkthrough_chapters_vulnerabilities.webm
  walkthrough_chapters_trust_center.webm
  screenshots/<recording>/
    hero/01-dashboard.png                 # curated, publishable stills
    hero/02-products-list.png
    frame_001.png                         # incidental timer frames
```

CI (`.github/workflows/screencasts.yml`, manual dispatch) records the same
targets and syncs `*.webm` and the screenshot tree to Cloudflare R2.

## The marketplace walkthrough

`walkthrough_chapters.py` is the source of truth: it holds the Pied Piper seed,
the four `chapter_*` step functions, and a parametrized recording that renders
each chapter as its own clip. `marketplace_walkthrough.py` imports the same
step functions and plays them back-to-back with title cards, so the long cut
and the short cuts cannot drift apart.

**For a listing, take the `hero/` stills.** They are named and numbered in
narrative order and stay stable across re-records, so an embedded
`hero/13-vex-preview.png` keeps working after the next run. The timer frames
alongside them are incidental — a frame every 3s, wherever the cadence lands.

Captions are burned into the video but hidden for the stills, on the assumption
that the video plays muted and the listing writes its own captions.

### Adding a chapter

Write a `chapter_*(page)` function and add it to `CHAPTERS`. It gets picked up
by both the tour and the per-chapter clips. Use `caption()` / `clear_caption()`
for narration, `title_card()` for act breaks, and `shot()` at the frames worth
publishing — renumber the existing slugs if you insert one in the middle.
